ðŸŽ® **Unlocking Easter Eggs with the Konami Code in JavaScript!**

Hello everyone! Today, I want to share a fun piece of code that brings the classic Konami Code to life in JavaScript. For those who don't know, the Konami Code is a sequence of key presses (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A) that was originally used to unlock special features in video games.

This is a fun way to add hidden features or easter eggs to your website. Try it out and let me know what you think!
